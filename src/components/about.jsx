                    Hello! I am Devin Everitt. I am a 27 year old web developer with a focus on the MERN stack
                    and keeping up to date with the ever evolving world of tech. I am currently working towards becoming a competent
                    full-stack developer, as at the moment most of my strengths lie within the front end of web development. Furthermore 
                    in the future i would also love to work on mobile applications that accompany already existing websites.
